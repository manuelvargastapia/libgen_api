# LibGen Mobile API

This is the backend for LibGen Mobile, the non-official mobile client for Library Genesis built with Flutter.

As well as LibGen Mobile, this project is Open Source, so feel free to collaborate. Check LibGen Mobile [README](https://github.com/manuelvargastapia/libgen_mobile_app/blob/master/README.md) for more details.

## libgen.js

Library Genesis doesn't provide a public API, so this project depends on [libgen.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/libgen#usage-searching). However, currently we're working with a custom fork of the original library to extend the main funcionality. Check the [repo](https://github.com/manuelvargastapia/libgen.js/tree/filter_by_fields).
